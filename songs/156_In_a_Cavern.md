In a cavern, in a canyon
excavating for a mine
Dwelt a miner, fortyniner
and his bottle Aquavit
Oh my darling o my darling
oh my darling aquavit
You are lost and gone forever,
dreadful sorry aquavit

When he’s digging, when he’s digging,
he sees something on a rock
It's a bottle, with some contents
could it be his aquavit?
Oh my darling oh my darling
it's my darling aquavit
Thou are back and here for ever
I will drink you aquavit.
